PostcardWare License:

PostcardWare means you can use the software for free (restrictions below), but to use it legally, send me a postcard, a real postcard!
This way you will let me know that the time spent on developing this software was not wasted and that what I am doing makes sense.
Please remember that I often use other people's libraries/source code. They share their work under their own licenses and should be acknowledged.

Limitations.
If you want to use my work in commercial products, let me know. We will then establish the conditions for such use.
If you share your work and use my solutions, the content of this license must be distributed with it.
The software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, even without the implied warranty.
